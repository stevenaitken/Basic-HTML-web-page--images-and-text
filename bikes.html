    <h2>Our bikes </h2>

    <h3>Hybrid bike</h3>

    <img src="images/hybrid-bike.jpg" alt="hybrid bike">

    <p>A hybrid is exactly what it sounds like – a mix of a road bike and a mountain bike. The result is a bicycle that's suitable for general-purpose riding over various types of terrain, which is why most hybrids tend to be used for commuting.</p>
    
    <p>Some hybrids are closer to mountain bikes than road bikes and others fall closer to the tarmac side of things. Our bikes fall somewhere in the middle which eans our bikes are ideal for some gentle off road mixed with tarmac. These bikes are ideal for family days out which allow for a little off raod excitment. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>HALF DAY £20</li>             
        <li>FULL DAY £30</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hardtail mountain bike</h3>

<p>Hardtail mountain bikes are a lot like Marmite: You either love them, or you hate them. The short and skinny is that a hardtail bike is really just that, it’s a bike with a hard tail. Impact absorbing suspension is only fitted to the front of the bike, while the rear end is fixed.</p>
<p>
    A Hardtail Mountain Bike is the bike to choose to explore most of the trails and forestry tracks that wehave to offer, and is a minimum requirement if you wish to explore the North Face Trail or Bridleways.
